# XSLT
XSLT is a transformation language that is used to transform/convert source XML documents to XML documents or to other formats such as HTML, PDF. 

Transformation happens with the help of the XSLT processor (like Saxon, Xalan). This XSLT processor takes one or more XML documents as a source with one XSLT file that contains XSLT code written in it and the result/output documents will get generated later as shown in the below diagram.
